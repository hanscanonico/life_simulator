# Design record

Dated entries that revise `docs/DESIGN.md`. Newest last.

- 2026-09-10 — Initial design of record written (Soup substrate, observables, sweep
  order, Rails + Rust architecture, mini-pc deployment).
- 2026-09-10 — First results: on 128×128 for 20 000 epochs, no run at mutation rates
  2^-16 and 2^-15 transitioned (compress_ratio ≈ 0.91, op_density ≈ 0.13, no replicator).
  Before reading any sweep as a negative result, a **positive control** must show the
  engine reproduces the published BFF emergence at all: experiment `bff-control`
  (2^17 tapes as a 512×256 torus, radius 0 = well-mixed, 64-byte tapes, 8192 steps,
  50 000 epochs, mutation 0 and default, 3 seeds each, sparse snapshots). Queued in
  production; runs behind sweeps 1–3 until run priority lands. If it never transitions,
  suspect the interpreter or the pairing rule, not the hypothesis.
- 2026-09-10 — Snapshot retention: full-world snapshots at every `snapshot_every` are
  kept only while a run is live (they are its resume point); terminal runs keep the
  first, the last, every 10th and the one nearest the transition.
- 2026-09-11 — Sweep 1 (mutation rate) finished: 100 runs, 128×128, 20 000 epochs, five
  transitioned (rate 2^-13 at epochs 5030 and 7000, 2^-12 at 15560, 2^-9 at 10670, 2^-8
  at 18080). The engine does reproduce spontaneous emergence of self-replicators from a
  random soup with no fitness function. The **window hypothesis of §1.3 item 1 is treated
  as not supported at this scale**: emergence appeared at four rates spread over five
  octaves, about one seed in ten wherever it appeared, with no peak between them and no
  upper error threshold inside the swept range. Only a lower cutoff is hinted at — 0 of 40
  runs at rates ≤ 2^-14 against 5 of 60 at ≥ 2^-13, one-sided Fisher p ≈ 0.073, a split
  chosen after seeing the data — so it is suggestive, not established. With 95 of 100 runs
  censored at 20 000 epochs the sweep measured censoring more than rate; `mutation-rate-long`
  (60 000 epochs at 2^-14…2^-11), `world-size` and the `bff-control` positive control are
  what will turn one-seed-in-ten into a number. Later sweeps hold the rate at 2^-13
  (`Lab::EMERGENT_MUTATION_RATE`) because that is where emergence was first seen, not
  because it is optimal. The `replicator_count` detector fired in only three of the five
  transitioned runs and ends at zero in all five, so `transition_epoch` remains a
  tape-statistics signature rather than a census of copiers; `bff-control` is still the
  gate on reading any flat arm as a negative result.
